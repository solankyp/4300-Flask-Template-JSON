The particles are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives the physicists clues about how the particles interact, and provides insights into the fundamental laws of nature. The instruments used at CERN are purpose-built particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before the beams are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions.

Cornell Spring Break Program in London - Global Health and Environmental Justice,"London, United Kingdom",London,United Kingdom,"Overview:
In collaboration with Global Hub partner, King’s College London (KCL), this program examines London as a global financial capital, a center of health research and policy, and a site where the consequences of climate change, including extreme heat events, are distributed in radically uneven ways. This program will bring students to sites across the city where medical practitioners and community groups are working to understand and confront environmental thermal inequality, from reproductive inequalities to mental health to chronic disease. It builds on a critical approach to global health, born out of the cross-currents of medical anthropology, science and technology studies, public health, global governance, and social epidemiology. A critical approach to global health asks how structures of power and inequality, from colonialism to racial capitalism, both limit the reach of biomedical technologies around the world and enable certain kinds of solutions to health problems to become favored. While global health is often construed as happening in the Global South (Africa, Latin America, South and Southeast Asia), students are challenged to understand the urgency of problems of planetary change and uneven development in a city that is often portrayed as a nerve center of colonial and financial power. In a moment where climate change is making the limits of global health even more apparent, this program presents an opportunity for students and a collaborative faculty team to reimagine global health’s relationship to environmental justice.

University of Oxford,"Oxford, United Kingdom",Oxford,United Kingdom,"
Overview:
The University of Oxford strongly preferences (and in some cases requires) visiting student applications for the Academic Year.  Some colleges will consider an applicant to study with them for just the spring terms (Hilary and Trinity terms).*  However, priority is always given to applicants for the full academic year, and Cornell supports this.  Students considering study in Oxford should be committed to a full year of study and appreciate the full ""Oxford experience"".  
At Oxford, a ""Tutor"" is a member of academic staff. They are experts in their field, and tutorials are a chance to get individualized teaching from them. At least once a week in each subject (course) studied, groups of 1-3 students will spend an hour with their tutor, discussing a topic in depth. This personalized attention means that you will face rigorous academic challenges on a weekly basis, encouraging and facilitating your learning in a way that just isn’t possible in a lecture.  Students are expected to prepare for tutorials with intense, individual reading and writing, so you should expect to spend much more time outside of class learning your subjects.

Visiting students at Oxford should not expect to study within more than one department, except in cases where Oxford offers a joint degree (e.g. Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, or ""PPE""). Successful applicants will pursue a course of study at Oxford that most closely aligns with their major at Cornell, and who have completed at least 4-5 relevant courses within that field. Note that some subjects, such as Management/Finance are extremely limited, especially for the spring term.
